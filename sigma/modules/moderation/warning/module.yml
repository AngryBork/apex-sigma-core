    description:
      Issues a warning to a user with the reason stated.
      The warning reason is not mandatory. When the user is warned
      they will be sent a direct message about it. Each warning
      has a unique ID that you can call and view with the warninginfo command.

    description:
      Lists all active warnings issued to the target user.
      The list is compact and shows only the warning IDs,
      the issuer of the warning, and when the warning was issued.
      A moderator with manage messages permissions can view any user's warnings
      while users without said permission can only view the list of theirs.
